        "Eggplant Parmesan is one of those great Italian comfort foods—a layered
        casserole much like lasagna but with slices of globe eggplant taking the
        place of pasta."

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/4 pounds globe eggplant (about 2 large)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil, divided, plus more to
        oil the sheet pans
      </li>
      <li>
        2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes (preferably San Marzano) diced,
        reserving the juices, or crushed tomatoes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the eggplant: Slice the eggplants into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick
        rounds. Lay the eggplant slices out on a rack over a rimmed sheet pan
        (or on several layers of paper towels). Sprinkle both sides of the
        eggplant rounds lightly with salt. Let the eggplant rounds sit and
        release moisture for at least 1 hour and up to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 4-quart saucepan on
        medium heat. Add the minced garlic and gently cook for 1 minute or until
        fragrant. Add the tomatoes and their juices, breaking up the tomatoes as
        you add them to the pot. Increase the heat to bring to a simmer, then
        lower the heat to maintain a very low simmer for 15 minutes, uncovered.
        Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the minced basil and remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the eggplant rounds: Place breaded prepared eggplant slices in the
        oven. Cook for 18 to 20 minutes at 425°F, turning the slices over at the
        halfway point, until they are nicely browned and fork-tender. Remove
        from oven, and let cool to touch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the casserole: Spread 1 cup of the tomato sauce over the bottom
        of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Place a third of the eggplant rounds in
        a single layer covering the sauce on the bottom of the pan. Layer half
        of the sliced mozzarella on top of the eggplant rounds. Sprinkle with
        1/3 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Place another third of the eggplant
        rounds over the cheese. Spread 1 cup of the sauce over the eggplant
        rounds. Layer the rest of the sliced mozzarella over the sauce. Sprinkle
        with 1/3 cup of shredded Parm. Add the remaining eggplant in a single
        layer on top of the cheese. Top with the remaining sauce and the
        remaining Parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake, rest, and serve: Reduce the oven to 350°F and bake, uncovered,
        until the cheese is melted and the casserole is bubbly around the edges,
        about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit for 10 minutes before
        cutting into to serve.
