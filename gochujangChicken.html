        "Gochujang is a red, spicy-sweet Korean paste made from chili
        peppers, glutinous (sticky) rice, and soybeans."Although gochujang is
        made with chili peppers, it develops a milder sweet heat during its
        fermentation process, as opposed to a more harsh chili blast.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup gochujang</li>
      <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
      <li>1/4 cup apple juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, grated or minced</li>
      <li>1/2 inch piece fresh ginger, grated or minced</li>
      <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the paste: Place the gochujang, maple syrup, apple juice, sesame
        oil, garlic, and ginger in a medium bowl or measuring cup. Whisk to
        combine. Place 1/2 cup of this paste in a small bowl and reserve the
        rest for basting while grilling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Oil your grill grates and preheat your grill: Using a paper towel and
        tongs, oil your clean grill grates with canola, vegetable, or another
        high heat oil. Preheat one side of your gas grill to medium-high heat
        for 10-15 minutes, 400°F to 450°F, or push hot coals to one side of a
        charcoal grill. The chicken will be transferred to the unheated side of
        the grill to finish cooking without direct heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill the chicken: Place chicken thighs, skin side down, on the oiled
        grates over the lit side of the grill. Close cover and grill for 3 to 5
        minutes, or until you see good grill marks form. Flip the thighs and
        grill over direct heat again, an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Move the
        chicken to the cool side of the grill, skin side up, brush with more
        paste, and close the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baste the chicken and continue cooking: After 10 minutes, brush the
        thighs with more paste. Using an instant-read thermometer, check the
        temperature of the chicken. It should read is between 150°F to 155°F, .
        Close lid and continue cooking until the thighs reach 165°F to 170°F, 10
        to 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush with additional paste and let the chicken rest: When done, remove
        chicken thighs from grill, brush with more paste and let rest for 10
        minutes before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish and serve: Garnish with chopped chives, sliced scallions, and
        toasted sesame seeds. Serve. Place chicken in an airtight container no
        longer than 2 hours after cooking. The leftovers will keep for 3 to 4
        days in the refrigerator.
